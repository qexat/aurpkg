= aurpkg

An extremely short bash script to open the AUR page of a given package.

== Usage

```bash
aurpkg <package_name>
```

=== Example

```bash
aurpkg yay
```

A browser tab should now open on the `yay` package info page.

== Why?

Because I am extremely lazyfootnote:[hi lazy i'm qexat]. Isn't that the reason of the existence of scripting in the first place?
